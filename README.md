# APPM 1650 - Python for Math and Statistics

## Description
This repository contains all the coursework and projects I completed as part of the **APPM 1650: Python for Math and Statistics** course. The course focused on using Python for mathematical and statistical computations, covering fundamental programming concepts and their applications in data analysis.

## Skills Learned
- **Basic Python Programming**: Variables, data types, and control structures.
- **Loops**: `for` loops, `while` loops, and iterators.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Data Structures**: Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
- **Functions**: Defining and using functions, lambda functions, and recursion.
- **File Handling**: Reading from and writing to files.
- **Libraries**: Using Python libraries like `NumPy`, `Pandas`, and `Matplotlib` for data analysis and visualization.
- **Statistical Methods**: Implementing statistical computations and visualizations.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
